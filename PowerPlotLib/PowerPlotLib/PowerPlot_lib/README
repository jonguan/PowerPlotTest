PowerPlot Library
=================

This is the public release version of the PowerPlot mobile library for
scientific and business charting. It runs on devices with iOS such as
the iPhone, the iPod Touch and the iPad. Using a manifest
MVC-architecture it offers both power and versatility for the
visualization of even complicated charts with multiple coordinate
systems. Using a set of factory methods it also allows the simple and
transparent creation of standard graphics without requiring an
expert-level knowledge of object-oriented techniques.

This directory contains the PowerPlot library that is released under
the GPLv3, see the file gpl-3.0.txt.

For the commercial version which does not force you to redistribute
derivative works of this library and allows App-store deployment,
